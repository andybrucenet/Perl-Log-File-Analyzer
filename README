LOGENGINE Package Readme, 9SEP01
--------------------------------
Copyright (c) 2001-2005, Andy Bruce

To use this package:
1. You must have Perl installed. I strongly recommend the
   Perl from ActiveState, at www.activestate.com.
2. If you do *NOT* have UNIX tools installed on your machine,
   copy the "pwd.bat" file to your Windows system directory.
3. Copy all files to a directory of your choice.
4. Read the "sample.rules" file to see how the logengine works.
5. Run the logengine by using the supplied "logengine.bat" file.
6. Play with the software! Use it to identify multi-line patterns
   in your own log files. Or in *any* type of ASCII file.

Be sure to look in the "rules" directory for a list of very simple
rules that demonstrate some of the package features. Hopefully, you
can use the rules as a cookbook for your own work.

I'm interested to hear from folks who find this software useful.
Feel free to drop me a line about the software and any suggestions
you have for it at andy@softwareab.net. I don't promise to
implement everything, but I certainly would like ideas on making
the software easier to use.

Thanks for using this package, and Happy Computing!
