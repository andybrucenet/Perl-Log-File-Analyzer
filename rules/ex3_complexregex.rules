# TO RUN THIS RULE:
# a. Change to the directory containing logengine.bat
# b. Run "logengine.bat -r rules/ex3_complexregex.rules -l logengine.pl"
# You should see the result:
#   2632 lines began with a TAB
#   93 lines ended with a PERIOD

# This script demonstrates multiple rules being evaluated simultaneously
#
# As such, this example demonstrates functionality *NOT* easily
# available through standard tools like "grep".
#
# Note that we make the variable declaration span multiple lines by
# placing a backslash at the end of the line.
