# TO RUN THIS RULE:
# a. Change to the directory containing logengine.bat
# b. Run "logengine.bat -r rules/ex1_linecount.rules -l logengine.pl"
# You should see the result "3625 lines in file(s)" after a few seconds.

# This *very simple rule* demonstrates the easiest possible
# match: a rule to count lines in a file.
#
# While such a rule has little value (the "wc" program works
# faster and more easily), this rule does show how the
# system works from a basic perspective.
